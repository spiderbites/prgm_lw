Goin' Steady DJs,11:00,02:00,The Bristol,Music,"<p><span>The story of Goin’ Steady belongs to a long tradition of DIY parties that popped up in Toronto as an alternative to the mainstream club scene in the early 2000′s.

Since Wolfgang Nessel’s departure in 2007, Matt Cully and Louis Calabro have continued to turn audiences on to the best of old fashioned beat music; from jump blues to doo-wop, swing to calypso, girl groups to surf and the weird and unseen world of American and international rock music.</span></p><p><strong>Music:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><a href=""http://www.goinsteady.ca"">Website</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/goinsteadydjs"">Facebook</a></p>",http://static.squarespace.com/static/53ed9849e4b07b4e476bd1f5/t/546f856ce4b0c97cacdde6c5/1416594797101/goinsteady.jpg?format=300w

Co-hosted by Chris Stein, from Blondie, and directed by filmmaker Amos Poe, the hour long show took television where it had never gone before: to the edge of civility and ""sub-realism"" as Glenn would put it. Walter Steding and his TV Party ""Orchestra"" provided a musical accompaniment to the madness at hand, and many artists and musicians, from The Clash, Nile Rodgers, Jean-Michel Basquiat, David Bryne and Arto Lindsey were regular guests. It was the cocktail party that could be a political party.<br /><br />With 80 hours of disintegrating 3/4 inch videotape as a starting point, we tracked down the trend setting participants still living today and found out what they remember of the period and how the show influenced their lives.
